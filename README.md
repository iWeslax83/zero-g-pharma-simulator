# 🧪 Zero-G Pharma — Space Drug Crystal Growth Simulator

## 🌌 Project Overview

**Zero-G Pharma** simulates how pharmaceutical molecules behave differently in **microgravity (space)** compared to **Earth**.

In space, due to **microgravity (10⁻⁶ g)**:
- Protein crystals grow **larger, purer, and more symmetrical**.  
- This allows scientists to design **more effective drugs** (e.g. for cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s).  
- Materials like nanoparticles or drug capsules can be produced with **higher purity**.  

This project aims to visualize these phenomena using **Python + VPython** with a 3D interactive simulation.

## 🎯 NASA Space Apps Challenge Theme
> *“How can we use microgravity to improve health and medicine on Earth?”*

Our simulator demonstrates how **gravity differences affect crystal formation**, material separation, and molecule motion — forming a bridge between **space research** and **biomedical innovation**.
